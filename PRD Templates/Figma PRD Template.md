# **Problem Alignment**

## **The Problem**

*Describe the problem (or opportunity) you‚Äôre trying to solve. Why is it important to our users and our business? What insights are you operating on? And if relevant, what problems are you not intending to solve?*

## **High-level Approach**

*Describe briefly the approach you‚Äôre taking to solve this problem. This should be enough for the reader to imagine possible solution directions and get a very rough sense of the scope of this project. (e.g., if ‚ÄúThe Problem‚Äù was engagement in the design process from non-designers, ‚ÄúThe Approach‚Äù might be a feed which surfaces work that's relevant to them.)*

## **Goals & Success**

*What does success look like? What metrics are you intending to move? Explain why these metrics are important if not obvious.*

# **Solution Alignment**

## **Key Features**

*Give an overview of what we‚Äôre building. Provide an organized list of features, with priorities if relevant. Discuss what you‚Äôre not building (or saving for a future release) if relevant.*

## **Key Flows**

*Show some mocks/embeds of the experience. Link to any other documentation as necessary. In general, it‚Äôs helpful to organize these around certain user journeys / use cases. Show enough of a clickthrough where people can walk away with a reasonable understanding of how the product works.*

*Embed example:*

‚≠êÔ∏è Now you can embed private Figma files, too!

## **Open Issues & Key Decisions**

*Keep track of open issues / key decisions here. Sometimes, certain decisions are made that might feel controversial; document these here so people know that the discussions have happened and there‚Äôs strong awareness of the tradeoffs.*

# **Launch Readiness**

## **Key Milestones**

*Identify any relevant milestones (e.g., a Dogfood or Beta milestone) that people should know about. Make sure to show when you‚Äôre expecting to publicly launch, too.*

| Date | Milestone | Audience | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mon, May 4 | Dogfood üê∂ | Internal employees only | Testing internally |
| Mon, May 11 | Beta üë• | Early cohort of 100 customers | Getting user feedback |
| Tue, May 19 | Launch! üöÄ | Gradual ramp over the day to 100% of all users | It‚Äôs the big day! |

## **Launch Checklist**

*Make sure you answer all of the questions below and involve necessary stakeholders.*

| Area | Question | Answer | Instructions if ‚ÄúYes‚Äù (or unsure) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Support** | Will new learning material be needed (or updates to existing documentation)? Help Center articles? Images/GIFs? YouTube videos? Plugin docs? | Yes | Talk to the Product Education team. |
| **Support** | Will this feature require new support processes, like saved replies, new tags to track feature changes, or training the support team? | No | Talk to the Support team. |
| **Growth & Data** | Have you implemented sufficient tracking in order to measure success, risks and impact on user behavior for the new feature? |  | Involve your data counterpart to make sure feature is well instrumented. |
| **Growth & Data** | Could this impact Growth numbers? (E.g., impact to NUX, UI changes to CTAs.) |  | Let the Growth team know. Consider running this as an A/B if you haven‚Äôt already. |
| **Growth & Data** | Are we turning this feature on for everyone immediately (versus a gradual rollout)? |  | Defend in this section why you‚Äôre opting for an instant ramp to 100%. |
| **Marketing** | Are we running a Beta for this? |  | Talk to the PMM team. |
| **Marketing** | Do we need an onboarding experience? |  | Talk to the PMM team. |
| **Enterprise** | Will this be available only in certain tiers (Pro or Org)? |  | Make sure the Enterprise team is in the loop and have good reasoning for packaging decisions. Also loop in PMM if sales enablement material is required. |
| **Enterprise** | Is this a new action that should be included in the Activity Logs? |  | Talk to the Enterprise team. |
| **Platform** | Are you introducing new functionality that we‚Äôd want to add to our Web or Plugin APIs? |  | General expectation is the feature team builds these capabilities into APIs. Talk to Platform team if you have questions. |
| **Platform** | Could this break any existing integrations (e.g., with Zeplin, JIRA)? |  | Talk to the Platform team. |
| **Platform** | Will this introduce new work on mobile or mobile web? |  | Talk to the Prototyping team. |
| **Security & Privacy** | Are you introducing new data models, or exposing new API endpoints? Changing anything with Authentication, Sign in, Sign up? Data flows to a new vendor or outside Figma prod? |  | Talk with the Security team. |
| **Security & Privacy** | Are we collecting any data that we did not already, or using any data in a manner we did not already use it in? |  | Talk with the Legal team. |
