# **How will we measure success?**

# **Notes**

1. Do not add the solution here.
2. An Intermission must always fit on a printed A4 page. If it does not, you haven’t a clear enough view of the problem yet. Keep working on it.
3. Always have active and upcoming Intermissions printed in your team area or war room. ­ Always use plain simple English, no technical terminology or codenames. Write this document as you would describe the problem to a colleague face to face.
4. The PM owns the Intermission, but should always always solicit input from the full team.
