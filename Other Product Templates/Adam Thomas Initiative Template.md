**Remember - THE GOAL IS ONE PAGE. Keep Cutting Until You Get There.**

## Abstract

*For this section, you’ll need to sit and write about what you are trying to achieve, who is it for, what is it for, who is affected by the work, what success looks like, the history of the team, etc. This section is where you’ll spend most of your time. However, it’s the key to understanding what you are spending all of this effort to build.*

*This is the paragraph that outlines the work, and it needs to be short. Someone should be able to read it and repeat it. When writing the abstract, one technique to consider is the [protostrategy method](https://uxdesign.cc/your-strategy-is-too-sacred-b4b85f6b8eee?gi=b58c96377c48) from Chris Butler — build a five-page outline, then cut that down to one page, and eventually, to a single paragraph. After completing the other four sections, you’ll come back to the abstract and finalize it.*

## Objectives

*How does this initiative tie into the overall product strategy? Your project should have a direct line to the company’s objectives and goals.*

*To get started, you’ll need to reread the company’s product mission/vision/strategy docs and relate your project to these overarching themes. Do not try to force a connection between your abstract and the company objectives. This should serve as a check to see if this is worth doing. And if it isn’t, you should stop here and **make your case as to why this is a waste of time.***

## Resources

*How are we going to staff this? Who is going to do what?*

*You want to collect all of this information in one easy-to-share place. You don’t want any surprises when the actual work gets going. Begin by looking at what (and who) is available and start talking to the folks involved to make sure they have an understanding of what’s at stake and what you need to get it done. Also - make sure you are clear about who needs to make decisions, and who needs to stay aware. However, remember it is their resources that you are going to need — they can say no.*

## Success/Survival

*What does success look like? What about failure?*

*To start determining the answers to these questions, look at the abstract, and start pulling the numbers. Make sure you add qualitative constraints as well, what are the third rails of this project? Think about survival, failure, and success, and explain it in terms anyone can understand. Describe exactly when to pull the plug [think about the resources you are using], keep going[what are some near term signs of success], or double down [success metrics].*

## Time Horizon

*How long will this take? Even better - when can people expect answers? Leadership will want to know how you are going to use the resources available to complete your project when they should check-in and on what timeline.*

*If you are at an “Agile” shop - start with an estimate of how many sprints the work will take. Try to remember Parkinson’s Law (things take as much time as you let them) and balance it with the Law of Slack (we never finish things on time.) You are never going to nail this, but an estimate will help folks make a “go, no-go” decision.*

## **Notes**

- Meeting notes and retrospective notes are great to add as the project goes on. This can function as a complete log of the project.
- It’s fine if different disciplines take copies of this doc and use it for their own purposes, remember this is an ***alignment document***. If teams are taking it back and using it, it’s a good thing!
- This document is alive. Take it with you to your meetings. Lead with it. When people are sick of talking about it, you are about halfway there.
